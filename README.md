# CS-330

My approach to designing software is to make small incremental steps from the designing stage to writing code. In this project we created a 3D scene using visual studio and OpenGL. We learned new skills each week - creating shapes, adding texture, adding lights, etc. Using what we learned step by step each week, I was able to slowly build out the final scene containing multiple objects, textures, and lighting elements. Taking it one item/concept at a time was helpful and by the final week I was able to create multiple objects and combine them to create the final 3D rednering of my desk. The incremental method used in this project will be something I will use in my future work - to slowly create things and testing constantly along the way to make sure things ar building properly. 

This course was an eye opening experience and introduction into computational grahics and visualization. Although I am not sure how much of this field will be in my future, I have found a new appreciation for those who are in this field. It is complex, difficult, and rewarding once understood (or once programs build successfully and run).
